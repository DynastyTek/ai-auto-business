   (This step may require a code from your authenticator app, SMS, or email)

3) Access https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications
   This page allows you to create and manage REST API applications.

4) Create a REST App named 'Small Business Marketing Toolkit'.
   Steps:
   - Click "Create App" button
   - Enter App Name: Small Business Marketing Toolkit
   - Select app type: Merchant
   - Click "Create App"

5) Save the REST API credentials and return here (masking secrets).
   You will need to collect:
   - LIVE: CLIENT_ID and SECRET
   - SANDBOX: CLIENT_ID_SANDBOX and SECRET_SANDBOX
   
   Security note: Mask secrets after first 4 + last 4 characters when sharing.
   Never commit these secrets to the repository.

Once completed, return to this chat with the credentials and continue with the PayPal integration workflow.
