# Payment Redirect Configuration

Goal
- After PayPal purchase, the buyer returns to a success page with download access (and can exit via a cancel page).

Implementation (LIVE)
- Integration: PayPal Standard (no backend required)
- Method: HTML anchor to PayPal "Buy Now" with `cmd=_xclick` and `business=<Merchant ID>`
- Merchant ID (Payer ID): 7LFWX7NY4VNZ2
- Amount: $29.00 USD
- Return URL (success): https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/success.html
- Cancel URL: https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/cancel.html
- Status: LIVE

Live "Buy Now" URL (for verification)
https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&business=7LFWX7NY4VNZ2&item_name=Small+Business+Marketing+Toolkit&amount=29.00&currency_code=USD&button_subtype=services&no_shipping=1&return=https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/success.html&cancel_return=https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/cancel.html

Activation / Verification
1) Ensure every CTA in website/index.html uses the exact URL above (the primary button has id="buy").
2) Deploy via GitHub Pages workflow (main).
3) Test flow:
   - Home → "Buy Now — $29" opens PayPal checkout with correct item/price.
   - Complete or cancel:
     • Success → /success.html (shows "Open my download"; reads product.txt when Payhip URL is present)
     • Cancel → /cancel.html

Digital Delivery
- Current: success.html links to the PDF (open access) and will auto-point to Payhip when PAYHIP_PRODUCT_URL is set in website/product.txt.
- Production hardening options:
  • Gate with Payhip/Storefront link
  • Tokenized download URL
  • Email-gated delivery

PayPal REST API (Roadmap)
- Not implemented (no secrets on the frontend).
- Next steps if desired:
  • Create REST app (Live + Sandbox) in PayPal Developer
  • Use Smart Buttons (client-id) for approval, then capture via serverless function (Netlify/Vercel) or webhook
  • Subscribe to PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED for receipts/automation
- Benefits: better order tracking, server-side verification, extensible webhooks

Notes
- Keep return/cancel URLs in sync with index.html.
- If merchant/account settings change, update the URL here and in index.html and redeploy.
