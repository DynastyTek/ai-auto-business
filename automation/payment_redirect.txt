# Payment Redirect Configuration

Goal: After PayPal purchase, buyer lands on success/cancel pages with download access.

Current Implementation: PayPal Standard with HTML Button
- Using PayPal's legacy button integration via hosted_button_id
- Return URL: https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/success.html
- Cancel URL: https://dynastytek.github.io/ai-auto-business/cancel.html
- Payment amount: $29.00 USD

Steps to Activate:
1) Replace YOUR_MERCHANT_ID in index.html with actual PayPal hosted button ID
2) Set up hosted button in PayPal account with correct return URLs
3) Test payment flow from index.html → PayPal → success.html

PayPal REST API Status:
- REST API integration NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- Current implementation uses PayPal Standard (hosted button)
- REST API would require backend server for security (client secret)
- Consider upgrading to REST API for more control over payment flow

Placeholders to Update:
- index.html: hosted_button_id=YOUR_MERCHANT_ID (line 56 and line 128)
- Both CTA buttons need the same merchant ID updated

Future Enhancement: PayPal REST API
- Would enable programmatic payment creation and verification
- Requires secure backend (cannot expose client secret in frontend)
- Would allow for better order tracking and webhook notifications
- Consider using Netlify Functions, Vercel Serverless, or similar

Digital Delivery:
- success.html includes direct download link to 7-day-social-launch-plan.pdf
- File served directly from GitHub Pages
- No authentication/verification on download (anyone with URL can access)
- For production: consider adding download token or email-gated delivery
